            <p>Kim Hak-sun was a South Korean woman who gained significant recognition for her courage in speaking out
                about her experiences as a "comfort woman" during World War II. Born in 1924, she was one of the many
                women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military. In 1991, she became the first to publicly
                testify about her suffering, which played a crucial role in raising global awareness about the issue and
                advocating for justice and compensation. Her bravery helped galvanize the movement for acknowledgment
                and reparations for former comfort women, highlighting the need for historical redress and support for
                survivors.</p>

            <p>Kim Bok-dong (1926â€“1997) was a South Korean woman who became a prominent activist for the rights and
                recognition of "comfort women," survivors of sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War
                II. Kim Bok-dong was forcibly recruited into the comfort stations when she was a teenager, and her
                experiences were marked by immense suffering. After the war, she lived through decades of silence and
                hardship until she began to speak out publicly about her experiences in the 1990s.

                Her activism played a crucial role in bringing international attention to the plight of comfort women
                and advocating for their rights and reparations. Kim's testimony and efforts helped to highlight the
                need for a formal apology from the Japanese government and support for survivors. Her work has been
                instrumental in the ongoing struggle for justice and acknowledgment for comfort women survivors.</p>

                In 1938, at the age of 17, Shirota Suzuko's father sold her to the Japanese military to pay off his
                debt. Until the war ended, Shirota had to serve Japanese soldiers as a sex slave at comfort stations in
                Taiwan and Saipan.

                From 1955, Suzuko lived at a shelter for victims od sexual violence for 20 years and published a book
                about her past experience as a 'Comfort Woman' in 1971.</p>
