        </center>
        <p>The term "comfort women" refers to women and girls who were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial
            Japanese Army before and during World War II. This tragic chapter in history affected thousands of women
            across Asia.</p>

            suffering and were denied their dignity.</p>
