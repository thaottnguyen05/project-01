        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Song Sin-do was born in 1924 in Korea, which was under Japanese colonial rule at the time. She was a former
            Korean comfort woman who became an influential advocate for the rights of survivors of sexual slavery by the
            Japanese military during World War II.</p>

        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>Song Sin-do was forcibly taken to a Japanese military comfort station during the war, where she suffered
            severe exploitation and abuse. For many years, she endured the trauma of her experiences in silence. In the
            1990s, Song Sin-do began to speak out publicly, sharing her story and advocating for justice for herself and
            other survivors. Her testimony and activism were instrumental in bringing international attention to the
            issue of comfort women and in the movement for reparations and a formal apology from the Japanese
            government. Song Sin-doâ€™s efforts have been vital in the ongoing struggle for recognition and support for
            the survivors of wartime sexual slavery, ensuring that their voices are heard and their suffering
            acknowledged.</p>
