        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Shirota Suzuko was born in 1928 in Japan. She was a former comfort woman and became an influential activist
            advocating for the rights and recognition of survivors of wartime sexual slavery.</p>

        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>Shirota Suzuko was coerced into a Japanese military comfort station during World War II, where she endured
            severe abuse and exploitation. For years, she lived with the trauma and stigma associated with her
            experiences. In the 1990s, Shirota Suzuko began to speak publicly about the injustices she suffered,
            contributing to the broader movement for justice and acknowledgment of comfort women. Her advocacy was
            crucial in raising global awareness and pressuring the Japanese government for reparations and an official
            apology. Through her efforts, Shirota Suzuko helped to ensure that the stories of comfort women were brought
            to light and that their suffering was recognized and addressed.</p>
