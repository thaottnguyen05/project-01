        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>Kim Bok-dong was forcibly recruited into a Japanese military comfort station when she was a teenager, where
            she suffered severe sexual abuse and exploitation. After the war, she faced years of silence and stigma, but
            in the 1990s, Kim began to publicly share her experiences. Her brave decision to speak out was pivotal in
            the global movement for justice for comfort women. Through her activism, Kim Bok-dong highlighted the urgent
            need for a formal apology and compensation from the Japanese government. Her relentless efforts have been
            instrumental in raising awareness and advocating for the rights of survivors, ensuring their stories are
            heard and their suffering acknowledged.</p>
