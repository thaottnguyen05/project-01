        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Kim Hak-sun was born in 1924 in Korea, which was under Japanese colonial rule at the time. She was a former
            Korean comfort woman and a prominent activist advocating for acknowledgment and reparations.</p>

        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>Kim Hak-sun was forcibly taken to a Japanese military comfort station during World War II, where she endured
            severe sexual abuse and exploitation. In 1991, she became the first former comfort woman to publicly testify
            about her experiences, a pivotal moment that helped shed light on the horrific abuses faced by over 200,000
            women. Her brave testimony was instrumental in raising global awareness about the plight of comfort women
            and ignited a movement demanding justice and compensation from the Japanese government. Kim Hak-sun's
            advocacy has been crucial in the ongoing fight for historical redress and support for survivors, ensuring
            that their suffering is recognized and remembered.</p>
