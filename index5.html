    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>Gil Won-ok was taken to Harbin, Manchuria, and brought to a comfort station in the winter of 1940, where, from thirteen to eighteen years old, she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Japanese soldiers. During the years Gil Won-ok spent as a victim of military sexual slavery, she contracted syphilis, which formed tumors in her body, leading to four surgeries. Due to complications, doctors gave Gil Won-ok a hysterectomy, which left her sterile. After the war, Gil Won-ok tried to go back home to North Korea, but when she got to the border, it was closed. Gil Won-ok is still unable to return to her home.</p>
