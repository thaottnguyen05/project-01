    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <p>Yoo was captured by Japanese soldiers at age 15 and brought to a brothel in Shimonoseki, Japan, before being tortured by soldiers there for a year. While Yoo was in the process of being moved to Singapore, the Japanese surrendered, and she returned home with the help of an Osaka resident. The organization that runs the shelter for former sex slaves, euphemistically called comfort women, on the outskirts of Seoul added Yoo's death and lowered the number of known survivors to 40 among the 238 victims who are registered in the South Korean database.</p>
